# Homepage

This is my test task, in which I made my first `resume`, in it I described all my technical skills. You can use it for your own purposes.
I also mastered the basic commands of **GIT**, and I learned how to work with the GitHub site.


### Quickstart
You can see the CV website by the link: <https://khanevich.github.io/homepage/>

### Create a new project based on the Homepage
Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., homepage).
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/khanevich/homepage homepage
cd homepage
```
